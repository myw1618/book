This can get even harder when multiple programmers are involved. Coding can be very rewarding, but it is also ful of pitfalls and requires a *trial-and-error* approach.  \n",

There are many platforms that allow to host git repositories, but the most well known one is [GitHub](https://github.com/). This is the one we are going to use. "
