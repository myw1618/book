Note that the temperature and density arrays are already initialised as arrays of specific length, rather than empty lists which we will then append numbers to. It is good practice to initalise arrays like this when we know exactly how many elements our final array will have. The for loop is used to cycle through all elements of our data list. Each ith element is a string, which we split into a new list with the same number of elements as the number of values that are separated by whitespaces in the line - in our case 2. Finally we can assign those values to elements in the temperature and density arrays, but first we converted them from a string to a float.\n",
