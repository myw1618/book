    "In order to make our programs efficient (or, at least, not horribly inefficient), we can consider how the execution time varies depending on the input size \\\\(n\\\\). Let us define a measure of this efficiency as a function \\\\( T(n)\\\\). Of course, the time it takes to execute a code will vary largely depending on the processor, compiler or disk speed. \\\\( T(n)\\\\) goes around this variance by measuring *asymptotic* complexity. In this case, only (broadly defined) *steps* will determine the time it takes to execute an algorithm."
