    "We say that vectors like the one above are a one-dimensional array of numbers, i.e. it only has one row so each element is characterised by one index which marks the column that it is in. If we were to increase the number of rows we would get a matrix, or a two-dimensional array, which then has 2 indices: one for the row number and one for the column number. We could further construct a three-, four-, and further hyper-dimensional arrays. Constructing multi-dimensional arrays can be achieved by nested lists.\n",

    "One of the reasons behind the speed of NumPy operations is that many of them are not actually implemented in python, but in C, Fortran, and other more efficient languages. However, this comes at a price, and some very handy options available for lists are not available for NumPy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, appending is not possible for NumPy arrays like it is for python lists. Let's say you have a list of 5 numbers and you want to append 3 more numbers to that list. What happens is that the computer has to allocate new memory to store those 8 numbers. When it allocated that memory space, it copies the 5 numbers from the list in the new array (memory) and then assigns the new 3 numbers to the other 3 positions in the array. Althought potentially very computationally expensive, this is just fine in python. The way that NumPy works is that NumPy immediately reserves just enough memory that it needs to store the array of the specified size, so the size of the array cannot be changed. There are, of course, ways of achieving a similar thing like appending to a list (e.g. numpy.concatenate() function), but they are not as user-friendly as list appending.\n",
